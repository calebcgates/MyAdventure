# MyAdventure
An Amazon Alexa Adventure Game.  

This adventure game is build using the Alexa-SDK.  It allows the user to travel places, buy weapons at the store, and fight zombies.
Not all of the responses are filled out as you buy more guns and travel around.
You can also examine objects.

I built this game to test the limits of Amazon Alexa.  It appears to me that such a free form adventure is difficult to wrap your mind around when presented in a audio format.
The number of options a user has almost required a prited cheet sheet or reference to understand what to do next dispite the limited nature of the game.

Please feel free to fork, add upgrades, or comment on how to build a better audio RPG.

Enjoy.
